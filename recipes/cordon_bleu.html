        <h2>How to Make Chicken Cordon Bleu</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span>Prep the Chicken:</span>
                <p>Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Assemble and Roll:</span>
                <p>Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Bread and Bake:</span>
                <p>Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How long to cook the Chicken</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. However, every oven is different â€” the chicken should no longer be pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
