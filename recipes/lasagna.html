        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>What you will need</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Meat</span>
                <p>A pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Onions</span>
                <p>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Canned tomatoes</span>
                <p>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Fresh Herbs</span>
                <p>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Sugar</span>
                <p>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Spices and Seasoning</span>
                <p>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Noodles</span>
                <p>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Cheese</span>
                <p>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Eggs</span>
                <p>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together). </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
